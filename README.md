# VirtualHipster
A music discovery and streaming web app.

Website: https://virtualhipster.herokuapp.com/

This is a project I made that allows you to both find and stream music. Last.fm is used to find the music, while soundcloud actually finds the song and plays them.

Important files:
Client side javascript: /public/javascripts/script.js
Server side javascript: /routes/users.js and /routes/index.js
HTML File: /views/webpage.html

Note: This app is super not secure, so dont use an actual password when making an account.

To run your own version, 
  Clone the git.
  Install node.js.
  Run "npm install" on the root of the project. 
  Run "npm start".
  Go to "localhost:3000" in the browser.
